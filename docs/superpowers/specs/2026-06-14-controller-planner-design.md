# Controller Planner — Design (Capability-Tuned Planners, Step-State Digest Board, Deferred Fan-Out)

**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Status:** DRAFT — for user review
**Scope:** the controller pipeline's planner/executor/reviewer interplay — design AND testing in one spec. Clean break of the `incremental | adaptive` planner enum.

> Consolidates and supersedes `2026-06-09-controller-planner-gnosticization-design.md`
> (now removed). Its Variant 1 (skills-RAG gnosticization) and its shared "per-step
> tool selection" change are already implemented; its Variants 2/3 (reviewer-gated
> completeness and self-expanding capable steps) are resolved here into the
> smart/weak capability split.

## Problem

Two independent evidence sources converge on the same defects.

**Live plan-generation capture** (real `claude-4.6-sonnet`, no execution, WITH/WITHOUT skills):

1. **The planner does not see step RESULTS, so it loops or bloats.** Its "Progress"
   is a payload-free blob of `[seq N name ok]` records, while `PLANNER_SYSTEM`
   tells it "fetched results appear under Progress." They never do (the full
   result goes to RAG; only a control marker is in `plannerPrivate`). Empirically:
   `abap-review` and `read-includes` re-emit the SAME fetch step 12×
   (`exceeded MAX_STEPS`).
2. **Plan-once cannot fan out over an unknown-until-fetched set.** For
   `read-includes` the plan-once planner either **hallucinated** names/counts
   (`…_TOP/_SEL/_F01`, fixed "Read include 1..6") or **collapsed** to one coarse
   step (`find-usages` → single where-used). Neither is real data-dependent
   expansion.

**Earlier E19 experiments** (from the consolidated 2026-06-09 spec) showed the same
under a weak executor: gpt-4o-mini **confabulated** a program's include structure
without ever fetching it (1 planner call, 0 replan, 0 error — confident but
ungrounded), while sonnet detected the gap but flailed ~207k tokens against the
wrong toolset. **Weak models do not recognise a missing prerequisite, so a
reactive replan trigger never trips** — discovery cannot rest on executor
intelligence.

3. **Executor capability is not accounted for.** A coarse "do it all" step suits a
   strong executor but a weak one confabulates / under-delivers; a fine,
   planner-driven decomposition suits a weak executor but wastes a strong one. The
   current design has no notion of which it builds for.

## Core Axiom

**Execution ≠ control. The executor, by definition, cannot judge how it
performed.** Control — verifying a step did what it should, deciding what happens
next — lives in the **planner + reviewer**, never in the executor. The two
planner implementations below differ only in *how much* structure they impose to
retain that control given the executor's capability; control itself is never
delegated to the doer.

## Guiding principle (engine stays agnostic)

Role prompts say "the live target system", never "SAP"/"ABAP", and never name
tools. Domain knowledge enters at runtime through two channels, so any model is
gnosticized as it works:
- **Pipeline hints** (`subagents.<role>.hint`) — static, per-role *operational*
  steering (never names tools); mainly to scaffold weaker models. (Implemented.)
- **Skills RAG** — dynamic procedural domain knowledge retrieved for the
  goal/step. (Implemented — the skill plugin-host; the former "Variant 1".)

## Architecture

### A. Two result representations, two consumers

| Representation | Where it lives | Who consumes it |
|---|---|---|
| **Full result** | run-scoped **RAG, addressable by step (`runId`+`seq`)** — existing `step-result` artifacts | the **executor** (a later step recalls a prior step's full output by seq) |
| **Digest** (the planning-relevant slice) | the **planner's step-state board** | the **planner** — strictly digest-only, never reads the full RAG |

The **reviewer stays a pure judging role: it RETURNS data, it does not persist.**
On each settle the reviewer returns its verdict plus a purpose-built **digest**
(and, for a discovery step, the structured `{id,label}[]` enumeration) — it
**decides what from the result is needed for planning** (a targeted extract, e.g.
*the list of include names*, not a generic summary). The **controller** then does
the durable writes and assigns ids: full `approved` → run-scoped RAG (as today),
digest → the board, and — for discovery — the `enumeration` artifact + the
`plan-decision` artifacts (§D, §F). This preserves the existing reviewer/controller
boundary (reviewer judges; controller persists).

### B. Planner context = a step-state digest board

Replace the payload-free `[seq N name ok]` blob (and the misleading "fetched
results appear under Progress" clause) with a structured board: per step the
planner sees **intent + state + digest**. Because the board carries state, the
planner (i) never re-issues a `done` step (fixes loop + bloat), and (ii) fans out
from a discovery step's digest (the digest of a discovery step IS the enumerable
list).

### C. Two capability-tuned planner implementations (clean break)

Retire `IncrementalPlanner`/`AdaptivePlanner` and the `planner: 'incremental' |
'adaptive'` enum. Introduce two implementations, **each with its own system
prompt**, selected **by the pipeline composition code** (the factory that
assembles the controller wires the planner matching the executor component it
pairs with) — NOT a user YAML toggle, NOT autodetection. The end user influences
it only by choosing a pipeline preset.

- **Smart-executor planner** — coarse / free steps; delegates in-step fan-out to
  the executor (one step "read all includes"; the executor lists then reads each
  in its tool-loop). This is the resolution of 2026-06-09 **Variant 3's** insight
  that a capable executor can self-expand — but control still returns to the
  reviewer after the coarse step.
- **Weak-executor planner** — fine-grained steps + **deferred expansion**
  (section D); never trusts the executor with multi-action steps. This is the
  resolution of 2026-06-09 **Variant 2** (planner-driven completeness, reviewer in
  the loop) without per-group machinery.

An optional **combined planner+reviewer** implementation is allowed: with no
separate reviewer, the planner produces its own digest from the full-result-in-RAG.

**Selection contract (concrete).** Replace `PlannerKind = 'incremental' |
'adaptive'` with `PlannerKind = 'smart-executor' | 'weak-executor'`, and replace
`makePlanner(kind, …)` with `makeControllerPlanner(kind: PlannerKind, deps):
IControllerPlanner`. The **composition code** chooses `kind` — there is no
user-facing `planner:` YAML field and no autodetection. Concretely:

- Capability is a property of the **executor component the preset wires**, encoded
  in the **preset builder code** (the factory that assembles that controller), NOT
  a user YAML knob. A preset that wires a small/weak executor model passes
  `kind: 'weak-executor'`; one that wires a capable model passes
  `'smart-executor'`.
- Named pipeline presets in the registry (`pipeline: { name }`): `controller`
  (default → `smart-executor`) and `controller-weak` (→ `weak-executor`). The end
  user selects a preset; the preset's builder is the single source of truth for
  the planner↔executor pairing.
- A consumer composing its own pipeline in code calls `makeControllerPlanner`
  directly with the `kind` matching the executor it pairs — same rule, no config
  surface.

**Pairing guarantee — two honest levels (no false "verified capability").** Nothing
can inspect a model and prove it is "smart"; a self-declared capability is an
operator ASSERTION, not a verified fact. The spec is honest about this:

- **Strong guarantee — preset-pinned executor.** A preset MAY own (pin) its
  executor model/endpoint, so the user cannot override it within that preset.
  Here the pairing is genuinely guaranteed (the preset chose both planner and
  executor). This is the recommended shape for the shipped presets.
- **Weak guarantee — `declaredCapability` validation.** When a preset allows the
  user to supply `subagents.executor`, that config carries a
  `declaredCapability: 'smart' | 'weak'` field (honestly named — an assertion).
  The factory asserts it matches the preset's expectation and **fails loud on a
  declared mismatch** (catches the obvious `controller-weak` + declared-smart
  footgun). **Residual risk, documented:** the factory cannot detect a *mis*-declared
  model (an operator labelling a weak model `smart`); that is on the operator. It
  is NOT used for selection — the planner is still chosen by the preset/composition
  code, never by this field.

(If a future deployment needs the capability to be data-driven rather than
preset-encoded, that is the deferred per-step `Step.tier` routing below — not a
new top-level toggle.)

### D. Deferred expansion (weak-executor planner)

The operative criterion (sharpened from 2026-06-09 V3): **is the step's
decomposition knowable at plan time?** "Analyze the program" is decomposable
up front (read source → analyze). "Read every include" is **not** — the include
names live *inside* the source and are known only after it is read. The weak
planner handles the non-decomposable case with **explicit discovery marker +
expand-on-success**:

1. The weak planner marks a step as **discovery** (its result enumerates the
   remaining work) and leaves the remainder unplanned.
2. When that step settles **`done`**, the controller **re-invokes the planner** in
   an *expand-remainder* mode (a new trigger alongside `REPLAN` /
   `EXTERNAL_RESULT_REPLAN`).
3. The planner reads the discovery step's **digest** (= the enumerated list,
   windowed at `maxFanOut`) and **fans out one concrete step per element** of the
   window.
4. Each window is recorded as a `plan-decision{kind:expand, offset}` so it is
   never generated twice; if the window was `truncated`, the planner advances to
   the next window (§D continuation). The discovery becomes **`fully-expanded`**
   once the terminal (`truncated:false`) window is emitted. (Identity & durability
   of these per-window decisions: §F.)

**Discovery-digest contract (structured, NOT free-text).** "Fan out exactly one
step per element" requires a machine-readable, validated digest — a free-text
summary cannot guarantee the 1:1 mapping. A discovery step's digest is therefore:

```
DiscoveryDigest = {
  items: { id: string; label: string }[];   // id stable+unique within the step; label = human/intent text
  truncated: boolean;                        // true if the list was capped at maxFanOut
  continuation?: Continuation;               // discriminated union (below), REQUIRED when truncated=true
}
```

**Empty is a VALID completion, not a failure.** `items: []` with `truncated: false`
means the discovery legitimately found nothing (e.g. a program with zero includes)
→ the discovery step is marked `expanded` with **zero fan-out steps**, and the run
proceeds. This is distinct from a MALFORMED outcome where the reviewer could not
produce a valid `DiscoveryDigest` at all (no `items` field / parse failure) — THAT
is the `partial`/`failed` → replan case. A 0-item completed discovery must NEVER
loop into replan.

Validation at expand time (only when a well-formed digest is present):
`items.length ≤ maxFanOut` (config, default e.g. 50) and each `label` ≤
`maxItemChars`.

**Continuation is a DISCRIMINATED UNION — its two semantics are incompatible:**

```
Continuation =
  | { kind: 'artifact-offset'; artifactId: string; offset: number }   // controller windows locally — NO executor step
  | { kind: 'tool'; token: string }                                   // needs a follow-up executor/tool step
```

- **`artifact-offset` (preferred, controller-local).** When the executor's
  enumeration is fully captured, the reviewer RETURNS the canonical `{ id, label }[]`
  array and the **controller** persists it as a durable **structured enumeration
  artifact** (`artifactType: 'enumeration'`, NOT arbitrary `approved` text — a
  stable, indexable array). **Identity & recovery:** the enumeration's `artifactId`
  is DETERMINISTIC, bound to the canonical discovery attempt —
  `enumerationId = uuidv5(runId, discoveryStepId, seq, attempt)`. A crash/re-review
  can append a second enumeration under a different `attempt` with a different list;
  the canonical one is the attempt selected by the discovery step's
  precedence-resolved + claim-fixed outcome (§F) — exactly ONE list is authoritative.
  Every `continuation` and every expand `plan-decision` references that
  `enumerationId`, so all windows index the SAME immutable list (offsets can never
  point at divergent sources). The controller windows it locally (`items =
  enumeration[offset : offset+maxFanOut]`) on each expand — **no executor/tool
  re-run**, so the offset is stable across crashes and cannot re-trigger discovery.
  **Durable write order (fixed): `enumeration` artifact FIRST, then the
  `step-result` that references its `enumerationId`.** A crash between the two
  leaves only a harmless orphan enumeration (no `step-result` -> the discovery step
  is not `done` -> re-review re-produces it idempotently via the deterministic
  `enumerationId`). The reverse order is FORBIDDEN — it would commit a `step-result`
  whose canonical digest dangles at a missing enumeration.
- **`tool` (only when the source itself paginates).** If the underlying tool could
  NOT enumerate fully in one result and exposes its own next-page token, that token
  is carried verbatim; the planner must emit a **follow-up discovery executor
  step** to fetch the next page (a real tool round-trip), which itself yields the
  next enumeration artifact / continuation.

The reviewer never FABRICATES a cursor: it either emits the structured enumeration
artifact (→ `artifact-offset`) or passes through a tool-native token (→ `tool`).
`truncated: true` WITHOUT a `continuation` is invalid (→ `partial`/replan). The
planner fans out the current window, then (artifact-offset) advances the offset
locally or (tool) emits the follow-up step, until a digest returns `truncated:
false`. A source that can neither be fully enumerated into an artifact NOR provide
a tool cursor cannot be safely fanned out → the discovery step fails loud (never
silently drops items).

The fanned-out steps are generated 1:1 from `items` (one step per `{id, label}`),
each carrying the source `item.id` in its provenance so re-expansion/crash-replay
is comparable. NON-discovery step digests stay free-text (§B). The full discovery
result stays in RAG for the executor; the planner sees only the structured digest.
The smart-executor planner does NOT use this — it emits the coarse step and lets
the executor iterate.

### E. Step-state machine (the board's vocabulary)

A step's board state is a **projection** of the controller lifecycle + the
reviewer's `Outcome.status` — NOT the raw `Outcome.status` (the planner does not
need `ok` vs `exists`; both mean "done"):

TWO separate axes — a **step-level** state (per board entry) and a **run-level**
status (the whole run) — because some blocking is about one step, some about the
whole goal:

```
STEP-level (per board entry):
planned ──start──► executing ──reviewer verdict──►  done      (Outcome ok | exists)   + digest: key extract
                                                     partial   (Outcome partial)        + digest: remainder
                                                     failed    (Outcome failed)         + digest: note
executing ──tool suspend──► awaiting-external ──resume──► executing      (a SPECIFIC step paused on an external tool)

DISCOVERY step only (sub-states of done — windowed fan-out):
done(discovery) ──first window emitted──► expanding ──terminal (truncated:false) window emitted──► expanded

RUN-level (the run, not a step):
running | awaiting-clarify | awaiting-budget | finalizing | done | failed
```

**Step-state set (locked):** `planned | executing | done | partial | failed |
awaiting-external | expanding | expanded`. **Run-status set (locked):** `running |
awaiting-clarify | awaiting-budget | finalizing | done | failed`.

**Windowed-expansion state model (locked).** A discovery step that settles `done`
enters `expanding` and stays there while windows remain; it reaches `expanded`
only when the terminal (`truncated:false`) window's `plan-decision{expand,offset}`
exists. Both are **derived predicates** over the present expand decisions for the
`discoveryStepId`, NOT stored flags:
- `expanding` ⇔ at least one `expand{offset}` decision exists AND no terminal-window
  decision yet.
- `expanded` (fully) ⇔ a terminal-window decision exists.
- **Next offset to emit** = `max(emitted offsets) + maxFanOut` while the last
  emitted window was `truncated:true`; the controller emits exactly that next
  window decision (idempotent — keyed by `offset`). When the last window was
  `truncated:false`, no further window is emitted and the step is `expanded`.
This makes the completion condition and the next-window trigger fully determined
by the artifacts; there is no "expanded set exactly once" — instead each
`(discoveryStepId, offset)` window decision is emitted exactly once, and the
discovery transitions `done → expanding → expanded` monotonically.

`awaiting-clarify` and budget escalation are **run-level**, not step-level: a
clarification request or a budget-cap pause blocks the whole run (it may arise
from the goal itself, not from any single step), so it does NOT belong on a step
entry. Only `awaiting-external` (a named step suspended on a specific external
tool) is step-level. (If a clarify is genuinely scoped to one step's execution it
still suspends the run at run-level while that step is `executing`; the planner
sees the run-status, not a per-step clarify state.)

Grounding: `Outcome.status` (`ok|exists|failed|partial`, reviewer-only,
`outcome.ts`) projects to step `done|partial|failed`; `InFlightStep.phase`
(`executing|awaiting-replan`) and the external-tool suspend already exist and are
merely surfaced. The genuinely NEW step states are **`planned`** (the cursor is
currently implicit) and the discovery sub-states **`expanding`/`expanded`** (the
windowed fan-out). Decisions locked: (1) step state is a projection (not raw
`Outcome.status`); (2) `expanding`/`expanded` are derived predicates over the
expand decisions (windowed completion, above), not stored flags; (3) blocking is
split across the two axes — `awaiting-external` step-level, `awaiting-clarify` /
`awaiting-budget` run-level.

### F. Step identity & durable board persistence

**Canonical identity.** A board entry is keyed by a stable **`stepId`**, NOT by
`seq`. `stepId` is assigned when the step first enters the plan (at create-plan
or at fan-out — for a fanned-out step it is derived deterministically from the
discovery `stepId` + the source `item.id`, so a re-expansion produces the SAME
ids). `seq` is assigned only when the step starts executing (monotonic, run-scoped);
retries/replans of the same step share its `stepId` and produce distinct
`attempt` values under that `seq`. The mapping is therefore:

```
stepId (stable, plan-time)  ──1:1──►  board entry / state
stepId  ──assigned at start──►  seq (monotonic)  ──1:N──►  attempt (retries)
```

**Retry vs replan are DIFFERENT identities.** A **retry** re-runs the SAME intent
→ same `stepId`, new `attempt` under the same `seq`. A **replan** that REPLACES a
failed step with a DIFFERENT intent gets a **NEW `stepId`** carrying
`supersedesStepId` → the superseded id. The board shows them as two distinct
entries: the superseded step stays terminal (`failed`, with its digest), the
replacement is a fresh `planned`/… entry. This prevents one board entry from
conflating two different units of work. (A pure retry never sets
`supersedesStepId`.)

**Outcome resolution = precedence first, `writeOrdinal` only as tie-break.**
Multiple artifacts can exist for one `(stepId, seq)` (retries, crash-replay). They
collapse via the EXISTING `resolveByPrecedence` semantics — `ok|exists > partial >
failed` — and `writeOrdinal` breaks ties ONLY within an equal rank (latest equal-rank
write wins). A plain "latest-write-wins" is explicitly REJECTED: it could let a
later `failed` overwrite a committed `ok`. A board entry's STRUCTURE (its
existence, `stepId`, instructions) comes from the canonical `plan-decision`
artifact that introduced it; its STATE comes from the precedence-resolved
`step-result` outcome. Board reconstruction is a merge of **THREE sources**, with
a clear precedence — a transient state must never mask a committed one:

1. **Structure** ← `plan-decision` artifacts (a step's existence, `stepId`,
   instructions, `slotId`).
2. **Terminal state** ← `step-result` artifacts (precedence-resolved
   `done|partial|failed` + digest). HIGHEST precedence — if a `step-result` exists,
   that is the step's state.
3. **Transient state** ← `step-start` claim + the bundle's in-flight/`pending`
   (a claimed-but-not-settled step is `executing`; a `pending` external-tool step
   is `awaiting-external`). Used ONLY when no `step-result` exists yet.

Precedence: **terminal (2) > transient (3) > planned (1-only)**. So the STRUCTURE
and TERMINAL states are reconstructible from immutable artifacts alone; the
TRANSIENT states (`executing` / `awaiting-external`) additionally need the
`step-start` claim + the bundle's `pending` (run-execution state, which lives in
the bundle — below). A lost bundle thus loses only transient in-flight precision,
recovered by re-deriving from the claim (re-`executing`) — never a committed
outcome.

**What is artifact-backed vs what stays in the bundle.** Reality check:
`persistBundle()` is an append-only `KnowledgeBackend.put()`; `hydrateBundle()`
takes the LATEST snapshot (last-write-wins); there is **no CAS** and `writeOrdinal`
only orders artifacts. So we do NOT claim an atomic fenced bundle update, and — be
precise — the bundle is **NOT** a "pure cache of everything." The **SessionBundle
remains the durable run-execution state** that lives nowhere else: `pending` /
external-tool + clarify suspension, the executor transcript, `toolCallCount`,
resume counters, `budgets`, and the in-flight `phase`. Losing those breaks
external-tool and crash resume, so the bundle is still persisted on every
transition as today. What becomes **additionally artifact-backed is ONLY the BOARD
projection** — the plan STRUCTURE and the step OUTCOMES — so a torn plan/board
write is recoverable:

- **Plan structure** ← `plan-decision` artifacts (below).
- **Step state** ← `step-result` artifacts (precedence-resolved). The step-result
  artifact carries the reviewer **`digest`** (and `remainder`/`note`) alongside the
  full `approved` content, so the BOARD's per-step digest — what the planner reads —
  is itself reconstructible from artifacts, not only from the bundle. (Without this
  the board would claim to be artifact-reconstructible while its digests lived only
  in the snapshot.)

**EVERY planner decision is an immutable artifact (not just expansion).** The
controller writes a `plan-decision` artifact for create-plan, every replan, and
every expand-window BEFORE the board reflects it — otherwise the initial plan and
replans would live only in the snapshot and a lost snapshot would make `planned`
steps + `stepId`s unrecoverable. `artifactType: 'plan-decision'`; payload =
`kind` (`create | replan | expand`), the produced/affected steps (`stepId`, full
`instructions`, `discovery?`, `supersedesStepId?`, fan-out `item.id`), and for an
expand the `discoveryStepId` + the `continuation` window it consumed.

**Finality is fixed by EXECUTION, not by a hash race.** An executed step is
IMMUTABLE — the executed prefix of the plan is never rewritten. A new planner
decision is computed FORWARD from the board (it reads the digests of already-`done`
steps — "what is done" — and only appends or replaces NOT-yet-executed work; a
pure-retry keeps identity, a replacement uses a new `stepId` + `supersedesStepId`).
So a later decision can never overwrite a step whose outcome already committed.
The only ambiguity is the narrow window where two decisions for the same
not-yet-executed slot exist (a crash/re-call before any of their steps ran) — and
there NO history is at stake, so a deterministic pick is safe:

- A decision carries a content-hash `decisionId` (UUIDv5 over `{runId, kind,
  anchorStepId, continuation?, plannerOutput}`). Identical output → identical id
  (dedup); different output → different id.
- **The winner is fixed at DISPATCH by a durable `step-start` claim keyed by the
  contested DECISION slot, BEFORE the step runs.** A claim is
  `{ runId, slotId, stepId, seq, decisionId }`. The **`slotId` identifies the whole
  planner DECISION, not a per-step position** — otherwise position 0 could claim
  decision A while position 1 claims a competing decision B, exactly the forbidden
  cross-decision merge. So a decision occupies ONE slot and a claim on ANY of its
  steps fixes the WHOLE decision:
  - create-plan → `slotId = (runId, 'create')` — one per run;
  - replan → `slotId = (runId, 'replan', anchorStepId)` — one per replaced anchor;
  - expand → `slotId = (runId, 'expand', discoveryStepId, offset)` — one per window.
  The winner for a `slotId` is the decision named by its **first `step-start`
  claim**; before any claim exists (the pre-dispatch crash window) the merge picks
  the smallest `decisionId` deterministically. The winning decision's steps are
  applied **wholesale** (all of its steps, ids AND instructions — never a
  step-by-step mix of two decisions). Once a claim for a `slotId` exists, that
  decision is locked and competing decisions for the slot are inert.
- **Concurrency: this design ADDS a per-run serialization lock (it is NOT already
  guaranteed).** Reality check: `SmartServer._withSession` only refcount-`acquire`s
  a shared session graph — it does NOT serialize concurrent requests, so two HTTP
  turns with the same session cookie CAN advance the controller in parallel today.
  "First claim wins" is sound only when one writer advances a `runId` at a time, so
  the design REQUIRES a **per-run async mutex** (keyed by `runId`/`sessionId`),
  acquired at the start of a controller turn-advance and released at
  suspend/complete — a new component, not an assumed invariant. For a single
  process this in-process mutex suffices; a **horizontally-scaled (multi-process)**
  deployment MUST back it with a distributed lease keyed by `runId` (append-only
  artifacts give no exclusive dispatch on their own) — stated as the deployment
  precondition.
- **Write order is fixed: claim → durable in-flight (bundle) → dispatch.** The
  `step-start` claim is written first; THEN `inFlightStep` (seq, stepId,
  decisionId, phase=`executing`) is persisted to the bundle; THEN the executor is
  dispatched. Recovery per crash window: (a) claim present, no in-flight in bundle
  → not yet dispatched → resume persists in-flight and dispatches (the claim
  already fixed the decision); (b) in-flight present, no `step-result` → resume via
  the EXISTING in-flight replay/suspend path (executor-call idempotency is that
  path's existing concern); (c) `step-result` present → terminal.

This gives finality WITHOUT backend CAS — but NOT without serialization: under the
per-run lock above, a content-hashed write-once decision + a decision-slot-keyed
pre-dispatch claim fix the winner before execution — never a retroactive flip, no
in-flight window in which the winner can change.

**Expand is per-WINDOW, so batching does not collapse the slot.** The expand slot
is `(runId, discoveryStepId, offset)` — NOT just `(runId, discoveryStepId)`. Each
`maxFanOut` window is its own `plan-decision{kind:expand}` keyed by its `offset`
into the `enumeration` artifact, so successive windows coexist instead of the first
one marking the whole discovery done. The discovery is **`fully-expanded`** only
when the window covering the end has been emitted (the one whose digest had
`truncated: false`). `expanded` (per window) and `fully-expanded` (the discovery)
are both **derived predicates** over the present `plan-decision{expand}` artifacts,
not CAS flags.

**Crash recovery:**
- **A `plan-decision` for the (slot, window) exists** → re-apply it (NO new LLM
  call).
- **None exists** (crash before write) → re-CALL the planner forward from the
  board; the new decision is written and execution-or-deterministic-id fixes the
  winner.
- **Window already expanded / discovery already fully-expanded** → skipped
  (idempotent).

## Components & boundaries

- **`outcome.ts` / reviewer** — the verdict gains a `digest` field (and, for
  discovery, a structured `enumeration`) that the reviewer RETURNS; the reviewer
  does NOT persist — the controller does (boundary preserved).
- **Step-state board** — a structured projection replayed from the `plan-decision`
  artifacts (structure) + `step-result` artifacts (state), rendered into the
  planner prompt (replaces the payload-free `plannerPrivate` blob). The BOARD
  portion of the bundle is a derived cache; run-EXECUTION state (budgets, phase,
  transcript, resume counters, `pending`, `toolCallCount`) is NOT — it lives
  authoritatively in the SessionBundle.
- **Two planner implementations** + the **expand-remainder** trigger; the
  composition factory selects the implementation.
- **`Step`** — gains `stepId` (stable), `discovery?: true`, and
  `supersedesStepId?` (replacement-on-replan link); the board carries per-step
  `state` + `digest`. `step-result` artifacts gain `stepId` AND the reviewer
  `digest` (so the board's digests are artifact-reconstructible).
- **`plan-decision` artifact** — a new run-scoped immutable artifact for EVERY
  planner decision (`create | replan | expand`), with a content-hash `decisionId`,
  written before the bundle reflects it; the board is replayed from these +
  `step-result` artifacts (§F). Only the board portion of the bundle is thereby a
  derived cache — run-execution state still lives in the bundle.
- **`enumeration` artifact** — a new run-scoped artifact holding a discovery
  step's canonical `{id,label}[]` list (deterministic `enumerationId =
  uuidv5(runId,discoveryStepId,seq,attempt)`), windowed locally by the controller
  for `artifact-offset` continuation (§D).
- **`step-start` claim artifact** — written immediately BEFORE a step is
  dispatched (`{runId, slotId, stepId, seq, decisionId}`, `slotId` = the whole
  decision); pins the winning decision for a `slotId` at dispatch time so no
  competing decision can win during the in-flight window (§F).
- **Per-run serialization lock** — a NEW component: an async mutex keyed by
  `runId`/`sessionId` held for a controller turn-advance (in-process by default; a
  distributed lease for multi-process deployments). Required because
  `_withSession` does NOT serialize concurrent same-session requests today (§F).
- **Reused / already implemented (do NOT re-spec):** per-step tool selection
  (`selectTools(step.instructions)` in `runStep`; the old prompt-level
  `selectTools(goal+prompt)` is gone — the 2026-06-09 shared change, DONE); skills
  RAG; `subagents.<role>.hint`; run-scoped RAG; fenced catalog CAS; suspend/resume;
  the `requires` evidence map.

## Error handling

- `failed` / `partial` → existing replan paths, now fed the board digest instead
  of the payload-free blob.
- Expansion is idempotent: a step already `expanded` is never re-expanded (safe on
  crash-replay).
- A discovery step that settles `failed`/`partial` → normal replan, NOT expansion
  (expansion only on `done`).
- Combined planner+reviewer variant: if no digest can be produced, fall back to
  reading the full result from RAG once (documented exception to digest-only).

## Testing strategy

Primary signal is **plan GENERATION**, not execution (agreed scope: "знімаємо
генерацію планів, виконувати необовʼязково"). Extend the build-excluded
`plan-analysis.ts` dev harness:

- Add an `EVAL_PLANS_ONLY` capture mode + data-dependent fan-out prompts
  (`read-includes`, `find-usages`) + full incremental/weak-planner trajectories.
- Capture, per prompt × planner, the **generated plan** (full, instructions +
  per-step state) and the **deferred-expansion trajectory** (discovery step + the
  fanned-out steps after feeding a synthetic discovery digest), WITH/WITHOUT
  skills.
- Assert STRUCTURE, never retrieval quality: no repeated identical step (the loop
  regression we observed); discovery step present for fan-out prompts under the
  weak planner; per-window fan-out count == that window's item count; each
  `(discoveryStepId, offset)` window decision emitted exactly once; the discovery
  transitions `done → expanding → expanded` and reaches `expanded` exactly once (at
  the terminal `truncated:false` window).
- Reviewer-digest unit tests: a discovery result yields a STRUCTURED digest
  (`items: [{id,label}]`, validated, bounded by `maxFanOut`/`maxItemChars`,
  `truncated` set on overflow); a normal result yields a free-text extract.

Plan-generation alone does NOT cover the real production risk — **settle /
recovery / retries and the crash window between expansion and persist**. Add
handler-level tests (the existing controller-handler test seam, with the
in-memory bundle store + a fake reviewer/executor):

- **Crash-injection around expansion.** Inject a crash (a) after the planner LLM
  returns but BEFORE the decision artifact is written (→ replay re-CALLs; assert no
  duplication via deterministic `stepId`s), (b) after the decision artifact is
  written but before the bundle snapshot reflects it (→ the hydrate-time merge
  re-APPLIES the persisted decision, NO second LLM call), and (c) after the
  snapshot reflects it (→ `expanded` predicate skips).
  In all three, on replay assert the fan-out is **neither duplicated nor lost** —
  an identical board and a single set of fan-out steps.
- **Dispatch claim fixes the winner — BOTH pre-dispatch windows (distinct
  recovery).** (a) Crash after the `step-start` claim is written but BEFORE
  `inFlightStep` is persisted to the bundle → on resume, no in-flight exists, so
  the step is (re-)dispatched, but the claim already pins the decision (assert the
  SAME decision wins, not a competing one). (b) Crash after `inFlightStep` is
  persisted but BEFORE the executor was dispatched → on resume the in-flight replay
  path runs the step under the claimed decision. In BOTH, assert the claimed
  decision wins and no competing decision's steps appear. Also assert a crash after
  the claim but before any `step-result` never lets a later competing decision win.
- **Retry identity + precedence resolution.** A step that fails then retries to
  `ok` keeps one `stepId` with incrementing `attempt` under one `seq`;
  `resolveByPrecedence` collapses to the `ok` (precedence `ok|exists > partial >
  failed`, NOT latest-write) — assert a later `failed` artifact does NOT overwrite
  an earlier committed `ok`; `writeOrdinal` only tie-breaks equal rank. A
  replan-replacement gets a NEW `stepId` + `supersedesStepId` and shows as a
  separate board entry.
- **Expansion-only-on-done.** A discovery step that settles `partial`/`failed`
  triggers replan, NOT expansion; NO `plan-decision{kind:expand}` is written and
  the step never enters `expanding`.
- **Idempotent per-window re-expand.** Re-invoking expand for an already-emitted
  `(discoveryStepId, offset)` window writes no new decision; the discovery reaches
  `expanded` only via the terminal (`truncated:false`) window, and a re-invoke
  after that emits nothing.
- **Slot-claim contention.** Two competing decisions for one `slotId` (different
  `stepId`s) → the first `step-start` claim's decision wins; the loser's steps
  never appear executing on the board.

(The exploratory plan-generation capture used during design lives in `/tmp` logs;
the harness extension + handler crash tests above are the durable, plan-defined
verification.)

## Open / deferred

- **Digest format** — RESOLVED, not deferred: discovery digests are STRUCTURED
  (`items: [{id,label}]`, validated, bounded — §D); non-discovery digests are
  free-text. (The earlier "start free-text everywhere" idea is dropped — free-text
  cannot guarantee the 1:1 fan-out.)
- **Per-step model routing** (`Step.tier: cheap | capable`, routing each step to a
  matching executor endpoint — 2026-06-09 Variants 2/3) — the deeper future layer;
  deferred. Capability is global-per-composition for now (YAGNI). A mis-tagged
  cheap step reintroducing the confabulation failure mode is the known risk that
  makes this worth doing carefully later.
- Live WITH-vs-WITHOUT *quality* measurement on real sap-skills + real embedder —
  separate effort, needs the user's env.

## Rejected

- Tuning the product `PLANNER_SYSTEM` wording to make a test pass (tuning a
  product prompt to a harness is wrong; the harness infidelity — payload-free
  Progress — is the real issue, fixed by the digest board).
