# @mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-libs

## 18.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 18.1 — Evaluator spine, hallucination guards, and the SmartServer composition library.

  - **Evaluator (per-level input judge):** the Stepper coordinator now runs an LLM Evaluator before planning that routes a step `executable | needs-work | needs-consumer` with a `missing[]` list, on by default at all depths; recursion requires it as a terminator. The `missing` gaps drive an additive, single-intent tool search (prompt-search ∪ needs-search) so a "review the program" prompt surfaces `GetProgram` while the needs surface `GetInclude`/`GetIncludesList`.
  - **Hallucination guards (Stepper executor):** an explicit no-capability error — when the Evaluator established a need but the toolset is empty after all seeding, the executor throws a clarify signal instead of fabricating an answer (`allowToolless` to opt out); and a token-grounding detector — a final answer produced with no tool calls, no grounding facts, and tools on offer is flagged (`hallucination_suspected`) with token evidence.
  - **New package `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-server-libs`:** the SmartServer composition runtime is now an importable library (between the binary and core `llm-agent-libs`). It carries `SmartServer`, `buildFromComposition`/`buildStepperRoot`, `StepperCoordinatorHandler`, coordinator config parsing, session stores, and the **pipeline builder-factories** `LinearFactory`, `DagFactory`, `CyclicFactory`, `PlannedFactory`, `DeepStepperFactory` (each builds one pipeline's `coordinator` stage handler from a typed config + role-resolving deps). `buildFromComposition` accepts a `makeRoleLlm` callback so factories work without the server's config types. `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-server` is now a thin binary that depends on it (behaviour unchanged).
  - **Clean plain-mode content:** tool-loop liveness markers (`[SmartAgent: Executing X]`) are now flagged `ephemeral` and excluded from non-streaming content accumulation, so `stream:false` responses (including DAG) no longer leak execution traces into the final answer. Streaming clients still receive them as liveness. The pipeline builder-factories also gained `build()` smoke coverage for all five plus an `execute()` integration test.

## 12.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 108cd1d: Complete the v12 package split: introduce `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-mcp`, `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-rag`, and `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-libs`. `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-server` becomes binary-only — composition surface lives in `llm-agent-libs`, MCP in `llm-agent-mcp`, RAG/embedder in `llm-agent-rag`, interfaces and DTOs in `llm-agent`. Top-level `makeLlm` / `makeDefaultLlm` / `makeRag` are now async (`Promise<...>`); `resolveEmbedder` remains synchronous and uses the existing prefetch contract. `SmartAgentBuilder.build()` was already async — consumers using only the builder are unaffected. Closes #125.
