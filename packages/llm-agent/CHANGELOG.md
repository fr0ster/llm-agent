# @mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent

## 10.0.0

### Major Changes

- Split single package into a monorepo with two initial packages:

  - `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent` — interfaces, types, and lightweight RAG default implementations.
  - `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-server` — default SmartAgent, pipeline, LLM providers, MCP client, HTTP server, and CLIs.

  Consumers of the v9 single package must switch their imports to one or both v10 packages. See `docs/MIGRATION-v10.md` for the symbol-by-symbol mapping and install-command changes.

  CLI bins (`llm-agent`, `llm-agent-check`, `claude-via-agent`) remain available and are now shipped by `@mcp-abap-adt/llm-agent-server`.
